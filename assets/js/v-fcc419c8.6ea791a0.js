Within the reported values of this cluster&#39;s data is a dp (so called “Data Point ID”) which is at the core of Tuya devices. From the point of view of a device the DPIDs are the functions that the device provides. The instructions below will help you use the Tuya IoT Platform with a Tuya gateway to determine the functions of the datapoints which, will later assist in the creation of a device converter.</p><h2 id="requirements-and-caveats" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#requirements-and-caveats" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Requirements and caveats</h2><ol><li>You will need an up-to-date version of Google Chrome (other browsers may work but, instructions may differ)</li><li>You will require basic knowledge of using Chrome and its Dev Tools</li><li>You will need to sign up for the Tuya IoT Platform and bind your accounts (more details below)</li><li>You will require a Tuya Zigbee Gateway</li><li>You will need the Tuya app (Tuya Smart) installed on your mobile device</li></ol><h2 id="instructions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#instructions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Instructions</h2><h3 id="_1-standard-part-of-the-setup" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-standard-part-of-the-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 1.
